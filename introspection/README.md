## Introspection
### Why must we choose you?
Dedicated to whatÂ I do. More than amFOSS wants me, I need amFOSS to build myself.  
I think I am the one who completed both 2020 and 2021 amFOSS tasks and still not in the club. So please consider choosing me :) 
I assure you I will never make U guys regret choosing me.

`Never gonna give you up`

`Never gonna let you down`

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I was an aimless, hopeless person till now
but now on, from next semester Iam thinking to work hard, get a good CGPA.






Apart from the academics if I get into the club, I can also improve my coding and other skills side by side which I think will be useful during placements.

### How would you contribute back to the club?

### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
