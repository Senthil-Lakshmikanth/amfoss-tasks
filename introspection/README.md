## Introspection
### Why must we choose you?
Dedicated to what¬†I do. More than amFOSS wants me, I need amFOSS to build myself.  

I think I am the one who completed both 2020 and 2021 amFOSS tasks and still not in the club. So please consider choosing me :) 

I assure you I will never make U guys regret choosing me.

`Never gonna give you up`

`Never gonna let you down`

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I was an aimless, hopeless person till now but from¬†now on, from next semester I am thinking to work hard and getting a good CGPA.

Apart from the academics if I get into the club, I can also improve my coding and other skills side by side which I think will be useful during placements.

### How would you contribute back to the club?
Iam a noob with no experiece and there are already many pros in the club. Iam no one infront of them when it comes to contributing. 

But whatever task the club assign to me, I will give my best üíØ

### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
The pipeline is really well organised. 

Iam just little nervous about the interview process. ( coz of my frnds ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è )

They : `they r gonna screw u asking ques + ques and all the technical stuffs.`

`Eventhough U do all these tasks by ur own, u r gonna fail in the interview round, so dont struggle so much` ( PS : Gud Prends )
