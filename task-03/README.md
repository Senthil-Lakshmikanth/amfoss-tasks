Except the 3 unattempted, the rest are ☑️ Correct 😢

Only few test cases with very big numbers terminated due to timeout. I even tested the codes against custom input, The logic is 💯 Correct

I just dont know how to optimise the code, but I will make sure I will study about time complexities in upcoming days and optimise these codes.
